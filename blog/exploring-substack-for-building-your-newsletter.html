itemprop="articleBody"><p>A few days ago I made a post on IndieHackers about my recent accomplishment. I counted my articles on Hackernoon related to #food-tech category and realize that during these years I published 24 articles. It&#x27;s a huge accomplishment for me and I was happy to share it with others.</p><p>But comments went in another direction. I get asked if I want to create a newsletter, related to food tech. And yeah, I&#x27;m thinking about it, but there are a lot of things to take into consideration.</p><p>I get asked if Substack is a great option to build your newsletter. So I want to share my takeaways here.
Let&#x27;s start with the basics.</p><p>Substack is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that allows writers to monetize their newsletters via a subscription model for various prices starting at $5 per month.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wghq0wmxwynhuzs2li8y.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>its focus on writers and WYSIWYG editor is easy to learn. Plus you can pick if it&#x27;s a free piece or if you want to send it to your paid users only. While it&#x27;s easy to write a post, there are still limitations to layout, i.e. you can&#x27;t put everything there. which is probably fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/124xithbow7opobviseb.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>it&#x27;s can be a great idea to start from scratch, especially when you just want to start publishing your content and don&#x27;t worry about everything else. It put readers first, which I also like. Not sure if I like an idea about &quot;premium content&quot; that is hidden under paywalls.</p><p>People that know me well, know that I have the motto &quot;Fuck Paywalls&quot;. For years I&#x27;m skipping magazines with paywalls and published my content on Hackernoon.</p><p>But there are some Pros and Cons, for sure.
You own your content and it&#x27;s great.
You can also easily export your email list, posts, and other data from your settings page.</p><p>From that page, you can download everything that is allowed by Substack right now. <strong>sarcasm</strong>.</p><hr><p>I remember times when you can download all your business contacts from Linkedin into a simple CSV list. But it&#x27;s not allowed right now I think... Private companies can easily change their directions, ie pivot and update their terms.</p><p>I also remember that I was able to download contacts to my 60k students on Udemy and use them. But now I have a limited option to reach my students via 2 fields form on Udemy and I also should watch my words and didn&#x27;t try to steal any traffic from Udemy(they better focus on applying some tools to DRM protection of video courses instead, so nobody can download them).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3ckgfsa7nsgrymor6xce.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Making money from newsletters is also fine. And the ability to set up paid subscriptions is a great way for monetization.</p><p>Here is a guide from Substack to take a deeper look: <a href="https://substack.com/going-paid-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://substack.com/going-paid-guide</a>.</p><p>I think they allowing you to connect your Stripe account via Settings
But what if your country doesn&#x27;t support Stripe(yeah, there are so many countries worldwide, you know)...
or what if I&#x27;m a crypto fan and I want to put some QR code or include unstoppableDomains links? not sure if it&#x27;s possible.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/girz814v6bgw8qs7oztm.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>As a company that wants to be profitable, there is some fee for sure.</p><blockquote><p>Substack allows you to use Stripe to accept payments. Stripe is available in select countries if you are not located in one of those countries then you cannot receive payments.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Both Substack and Stripe take their cut from each transaction. Substack charges 10% and Stripe charges 2.9% + 30 cents on each transaction. This means if you charge $10 per subscriber then the Substack + Stripe fee will be 1.59.
This may not sound a lot but let&#x27;s suppose you have 100 paid subscribers each paying $10 per month. You&#x27;ll be paying $159 each month and $1908 each year.</p></blockquote><p>While I&#x27;m fine with that(my Udemy profile has &quot;<em>your IRS withholding tax rate is 24%</em>&quot;), someone might be angry to share their profits.</p><p>SEO is a huge topic to talk about too. Basically, when you try to grow and promote your newsletter - you&#x27;ll send traffic to the substack website and work for growing their SEO index. And if you decide to part ways - you&#x27;ll need to start from scratch with all those links, etc.</p><hr><p>Limited integrations also limit your potential to access other tools that may help you convert more visitors into paying subscribers.</p><p>A huge plus is simplicity. You don&#x27;t need to be a pro in order to start. But again, you will be limited by a platform for sure.</p><p>There is a limit to earning from a single model of monetization. The only paywall is available, so...</p><p>Imagine this situation: you work hard and be able to grow your reader&#x27;s list. let&#x27;s assume it&#x27;s related to tech.</p><p>Your archive page(list of previously published pieces) gets a lot of traffic and you want to add it to the sidebar. CarbonAds(<a href="https://www.carbonads.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.carbonads.net/</a>) you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do that.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/onqpeg3hvbbdhq1ituiy.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Another issue is SEO limitation. All images are hosted on their CDN. Probably they wouldn&#x27;t be indexed as part of your newsletter here is a link: <code>https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_704,h_396,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F590aa007-1c00-4f98-abcb-f717db528128_4032x3024.jpeg</code></p><p>they don&#x27;t put alts, so ...
<code>&lt;img class=&quot;post-preview-inner-image&quot; src=&quot;{URL}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;</code></p><p><strong>Censorship</strong>. I don&#x27;t know about situations where substack limited free speech or anything, but as a public company, I&#x27;m sure they have some rules or moderations inside. While I&#x27;m sure that HN readers are following some rules, there is always another side.</p><p>A few years ago there was a situation when Patreon decided to ban some accounts because of a violation of rules. Jordan Peterson was affected I think</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jordan-peterson-says-hell-launch-patreon-alternative-before-christmas-2018-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.businessinsider.com/jordan-peterson-says-hell-launch-patreon-alternative-before-christmas-2018-12</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_OrrvaVVw&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8_OrrvaVVw&amp;feature=emb_title</a></p><p>Quick mention(I didn&#x27;t explore this tool).</p><p><strong>ConvertKit</strong> can be an alternative, btw: <a href="https://convertkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://convertkit.com/</a>.</p><p>Again, substack is a great choice if you want to focus on content and don&#x27;t distract your users with ads or something else boring. But if you will need some additional features that aren&#x27;t in their roadmap - sorry.</p><p>You can also benefit from their userbase. substack has more than 500k paying subscribers. And if you get featured, you can get some additional users from that. But as a starter, it will be hard to get featured. And I&#x27;m not sure if you are ready to do it.</p><p>Plus, it&#x27;s a competitive field. Like if you have your own website, your marketing, your newsletter, and people go to it to read your content - it&#x27;s your users. with the substack case, your visitors can end up on some other profiles and as it&#x27;s a platform that unites - they have the right to switch. is it good or not - it&#x27;s upon you.</p><p>When I was running my previous company, we don&#x27;t have a website and got clients from Elance website for freelancers. We have quite a good profile, reviews, etc. We get into 14th LVL which is a quite good accomplishment in my opinion. But when they decided to merge with oDesk and become an Upwork, shit things start to happen.</p><p>But for details, I&#x27;ll advise reading articles from Nebojsa Todorovic: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/u/nebojsa.todorovic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://hackernoon.com/u/nebojsa.todorovic</a>.</p><p>After that situation, I&#x27;ll probably advise you to build your own website and invest money into promoting it, instead of promoting your profiles.</p><p>Let&#x27;s imagine another situation. You have an upcoming product that you want to promote to your readers. In my situation, it&#x27;s tools for newsletters or modules for food tech startups.</p><p>Will you be able to use your current userbase? I don&#x27;t know.</p><p>Let&#x27;s imagine that you created Landing Page with a lead magnet. Will you be able to add people that subscribed to that product to your Substack list? I don&#x27;t think so.</p><p>As substack controlling subscription flow, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to change something there.</p><p>Or what if you want to grow your newsletter and sell it later? I don&#x27;t think someone will buy access to your Substack account 🙂
And if you decide to migrate away, you&#x27;ll probably lose some users.</p><p>Recently I find this marketplace for selling newsletters: <a href="https://duuce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://duuce.com/</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xsuw4nwu4mfmw62fkqjb.png" alt="Image description" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I recall a similar situation with Youtube creators. While recently Youtube added some features for monetization, there are still a lot of cases when people lost their monetization or got some claims from copyright owners.</p><p>If you react to some videos - you can get demonetized, if someone reports your video - it can be deleted, etc.</p><p>This is why some creators are leaving YT or exploring other alternatives.</p><p>There are a lot of great people that doing cool education videos. And as they want to grow and expand their businesses - they moving part of their content into <a href="https://curiositystream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://curiositystream.com/</a> or <a href="https://nebula.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://nebula.app/</a></p><p>From Nebula website:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exclusive content</strong>.
